# Database-SQL

The purpose of the project is to realize an online auction application linked to a relational database for a fictitious customer, the Gange company. The company wants to implement a database describing the technical characteristics of the products as well as their status with respect to the auctions (current price, completed bids).
For that, the company provided a textual report describing the various relations and the entities which it wishes to see appearing in the database.
This specification in textual form was converted into functional dependencies, constraints, then entity/association diagram and normalized relational.
A Java program allowing to automatically insert data in the database was created.

# Code
The source code of the final project is not publicly available because this project will be proposed again next year at ENSIMAG.
